# Password-Generator

This project is a password generator. In order to generate a password the user will use the range slider to dictate the amount of characters they'd like and check which type of characters they'd like to include in the password.

The program will validate whether any of the options have been selected. If none have been selected, the program will alert the user to select at least one.

The program will identify which options have been selected as well as counting how many of the choices were selected.

Based on the value from the range slider and the options checked, the program will generated a password on those parameters.
